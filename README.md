# Vulnerability-Mangement-Lab

# Introduction
We'll examine vulnerability remediation and scanning. The Vulnerability Management Lifecycle consists of these two key components. We will execute credentialed scans to find vulnerabilities, fix some of the vulnerabilities, and then run another scan to confirm remediation, we will be utilizing Nessus Essentials to scan local virtual machines (VMs) hosted on Oracle VM Virtualbox. This lab was inspired by Josh Madakor @joshmadakor1 !
